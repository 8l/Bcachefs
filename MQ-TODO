TODO list for multiqueue/new-queue. In no particular order.
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Batch IPI signalling to re-direct IOs at lower cost

- Better switching scheme for deciding when to run
  queues inline and when to punt to kblockd.

- Support for limiting queue depth
	- Retrieves batches of queue credits from hw_ctx

- Allow driver to pass in a mq_ops->submit_rq fn
	- If set, we can split the work between ->queue_rq
	  and ->submit_rq, where the latter talks to the hw
	  to fire off multiple requests at once.
	- Useful for mtip32xx, where the port issue lock is
	  really hot. This relies on the fact that we normally
	  fire off > 1 request for each run of the queue.

- Implement proper scheme for not having lots of processes
  or kblockds hammering on blk_mq_run_hw_queue() at the same
  time. If someone else is already running the queue, we need
  not do anything.
